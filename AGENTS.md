# Style Guides

## Communication

- Phrase positively or neutrally; avoid negations and "not this, but that" contrasts.
- Frame positively: show the promising, successful aspects of the recommended path. Mention an alternative only when its trade-offs deserve our attention.
- The reader has limited working memory and limited ability to search back through recent text. Include only what the current focus needs.

Sixteen actions that improve writing:
1. Sand off filler words
2. Find the real actors
3. Restore actions to verbs
4. Delete empty verbs
5. Prefer characters as subjects
6. Put subjects and verbs together
7. Put verbs and objects together
8. Make the opening familiar
9. Put new and important information last
10. Repair topic flow
11. Repair stress flow
12. Establish a clear topic sentence
13. Make subjects consistent across a passage
14. Control passive voice deliberately
15. Name responsibility
16. Trim metadiscourse

## Coding: Design By Contract

We document and `assert` every precondition our code relies on (`debug_assert` only on hot paths). Contracts are **expansive** (the caller carries the responsibility), **conceptually simple** (a few sentences of English; simplicity beats familiarity), and **structurally simple** to enforce (few lines, types, data elements, conditionals).

We never write "defensive code" — code that complicates a contract to ease the caller's life. When running code detects that a caller misunderstood the contract, it **fails stop**: panic with a clear message. Stopping is safer than proceeding, and it lets people fix the caller or loosen the contract. Defensive codebases grow buggier over time; DBC codebases stay predictable.

## Interfaces: fewest new concepts

A highly desirable property of an interface and its contract: the user learns the fewest new concepts. Zero new concepts earns a perfect score. Each new term (a resource unit, a sharing rule, a tuning knob) taxes working memory and needs a place in prediction and control. Prefer familiar concepts the caller already holds (threads, inputs, budgets), keep implementation units unnamed in public docs, and express observable behavior (speed, thread count, fairness beside concurrent calls) in those familiar terms.

# Environment

## Where things are

- `/workspace` is the host checkout of this fork (github.com/johnservil/BLAKE3, branch `sme2-bench`), mounted through sandboxfs. It persists across VM restarts.
- `/workspace/bench-hashes` is the benchmark's own repository (github.com/johnservil/bench-hashes, branch `main`), nested inside the fork. Its `Cargo.toml` and `build.rs` point the `blake3-servil` path dependency at `..`, so edits to the fork take effect on the benchmark's next build. `/workspace/.git/info/exclude` keeps it, `benchmark-results/`, `tmp/`, `vm/`, and the token out of the fork's status.
- `/workspace/vm/` holds everything the guest needs that a restart would otherwise remove:
  - `vm/home/` is `HOME` for `git` and `cargo`: `.gitconfig` with `safe.directory = *`, John Servil's `user.name`/`user.email`, and the credential helper.
  - `vm/home/bin/gh-cred.sh` speaks the git credential protocol and reads the johnservil classic token from `/workspace/ghtokenclassic.txt` (never print that file). Both repos have `credential.helper = !sh /workspace/vm/home/bin/gh-cred.sh` (the mount drops executable bits, hence `!sh`).
  - `vm/setup.sh` installs `clang-19` from apt.llvm.org when it is absent, creates `/tmp/target`, and re-points both repos' credential helpers. Run `sh /workspace/vm/setup.sh` first after a VM restart.
- Guest disk (`/tmp`, `/usr`, apt packages) vanishes with the VM. Only `/workspace` persists.

## Building and running

- The VM is Debian 12 on AArch64 with two cores. Its CPU exposes SME2 with 512-bit streaming vectors (`/proc/cpuinfo` lists `sme2`), so the fork's kernels run here. Absolute timings differ from Apple hardware; relative comparisons hold.
- The fork's SME2 kernel is `c/blake3_sme2_aarch64.S`, compiled by the `cc` crate with `-march=armv9-a+sme2`. The system `cc` (GCC 12) and `as` (binutils 2.40) predate SME2, so the fork's build script fails under them with a message naming the fix. `clang-19` assembles SME2; `TMPDIR` gives clang a temporary directory that exists in the guest.
- Every `git` and `cargo` command takes `HOME=/workspace/vm/home`. Files on the mount show as uid 501 while the guest runs as uid 0, which is what `safe.directory` covers.
- Build the fork: `HOME=/workspace/vm/home CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/target CC=clang-19 TMPDIR=/tmp cargo build --release`
- Run the benchmark: `HOME=/workspace/vm/home CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/target CC=clang-19 TMPDIR=/tmp cargo run --release --manifest-path /workspace/bench-hashes/Cargo.toml -- --contenders blake3,blake3-servil`
- `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/target` is a tmpfs build cache (rebuilt after a restart); `CARGO_HOME=/usr/local/cargo`. The toolchain is rustc 1.98.1 without the `rustfmt` component, so there is no formatting check in the guest.
- Commands for the user go on one line, with no `\` continuations.
- Never `sleep` in commands. When a network call fails, report it and stop; the user decides about retries.
- Run long commands (builds, benchmark runs, package installs) without a timeout and let their output stream, so the user can watch progress and interrupt when they choose.
